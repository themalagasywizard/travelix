# Travel Journal — Privacy Policy (Draft v1)

_Last updated: 2026-02-24_

Travel Journal is designed to be local-first.

## 1) What data the app stores

Travel Journal stores the content you create, including:

- Places
- Visits (dates, notes, summaries)
- Spots and recommendations
- Tags
- Imported media metadata and cached thumbnails

By default, this data is stored on-device in the app’s local database.

## 2) Photos and media

If you import photos, Travel Journal stores media references/records needed to show your content and generate thumbnails for performance.

Travel Journal does not upload photos to any remote server by default.

## 3) iCloud sync (optional)

If you enable **iCloud Sync** in Settings, Travel Journal may sync your records through your **private iCloud database** (CloudKit private scope) associated with your Apple ID.

When iCloud Sync is disabled, sync operations do not run.

## 4) Analytics and tracking

Travel Journal does not include third-party ad tracking SDKs in v1.

## 5) Data sharing

Travel Journal does not sell your personal data.

## 6) Data deletion

You can delete visits and related records inside the app. If iCloud Sync is enabled, deletions are propagated as sync tombstones.

## 7) Contact

For privacy questions or deletion requests related to distributed test builds, contact the app maintainer.
